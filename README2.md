# Java-Algorithm-Problem
Can anybody help me? 
I'm struggling with this question.
I almost implemented it but I got runtime error because I think I exceeded memory limit.

I put the question below :

* time limit : 1000ms
* memory limit : 65535KB

#Question

Misspelling is an art form that students seem to excel at. Write a program that removes the nth
character from an input string.

#Input

The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.
Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing M, a space, and a single word made up of uppercase letters only. M will be less than or equal to the length of the word. The length of the word is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 80.

#Output

For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset
number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the misspelled word. The
misspelled word is the input word with the indicated character deleted.
